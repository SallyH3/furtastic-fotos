# Furtastic-Fotos

## Abstract:

As a solo code challenge, I had to create a React app in which the user selects a target API from which to pull a list of images, and renders those images on the page. The API used was [Dog API](https://dog.ceo/dog-api/).

## Setup:

First, clone down the repo.

```bash
git clone 
```

Once you have cloned the repo, install the library dependencies. Run:

```bash
npm install
```
